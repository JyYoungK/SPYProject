    "artistBio": "Some may dismiss pop as inauthentic. But for Lady Gaga—one of popular culture’s greatest, most extravagant creations—the inauthenticity is the point. No artist has more defiantly embodied that provocation this century than the one born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta (in New York in 1986). Never wedded to the same image—one minute wearing a dress made of raw meat at the MTV VMAs, the next a coat of Kermit the Frog puppets on German TV—Gaga personifies pop’s surface obsessions while simultaneously upending them.<br>\nIn a sense, her creative identity had crystallized by age 21, having been a child pianist, aspiring actor, and burlesque performer. Each of these facets powered her career’s most distinct parts: the celebrity fascination of her first two albums, 2008’s <i>The Fame</i> and 2009’s <i>The Fame Monster</i>; the subversive layering of 2011’s <i>Born This Way</i> and 2013’s <i>ARTPOP</i>; the sincere reverence of 2014’s <i>Cheek to Cheek</i>, her jazz standards album with Tony Bennett; and the rootsier songwriting of 2016’s <i>Joanne</i>. If 2009’s “Paparazzi” reveled in the flashes, then “Born This Way” celebrated inner light: In translating her diffuse identity into world-conquering art, Gaga has become a beacon to anyone else who’s felt like an outsider. Her loyal following—a.k.a. Little Monsters—has affirmed a deep connection to her message of self-love and self-expression, despite pop’s fickleness and her chameleonic exterior. She played out a simpler version of her path to fame in the 2018 remake of <i>A Star Is Born</i>: But while her character’s ascent was abetted by her lover, Gaga’s was all her own."

            "artistBio": "When Madonna Louise Ciccone was 15, she put on a black silk cape and the biggest platform shoes she owned, snuck out of her bedroom window in suburban Michigan, and hitchhiked to Detroit to see David Bowie live. The night changed her life—not just because the music was great, but because, as she put it more than 20 years later while accepting Bowie’s induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, “it was great theater. Here was this beautiful, androgynous man, just being so…<i>perverse</i>.” More than a musician, Madonna—like Bowie then and Kanye West now—is a supreme cultural curator. She's an artist capable of combining styles and images in ways that are both novel and groundbreaking, who changes with such frequency and confidence that change has become her defining characteristic.<br>\nBorn in Bay City, Michigan, in 1958, she spent her childhood studying ballet, later moving to New York to try and make it as a dancer. (She was fired from a brief stint at a Times Square Dunkin’ Donuts after spraying a customer—either accidentally or on purpose, she never confirmed—with donut jelly.) After playing in a couple of New Wave bands, she went solo, exploring a simple, almost punky, almost amateurish take on dance music (“Borderline,” “Lucky Star”) that brought the grandeur of disco down to human scale. She remained more or less invincible throughout the '80s, releasing a string of albums (<i>Like a Virgin</i>, <i>True Blue</i>, and <i>Like a Prayer</i>) that continue to define the era. Like Prince, her music was immediate but her character was incredibly complex: She could be brassy (“Material Girl”) and sweet (“Open Your Heart”), earnest (“Papa Don’t Preach”) and playful (“Like a Virgin”), sacred and profane—a variety that widened the emotional spectrum for pretty much every female pop artist in her wake.<br>\nIn the ’90s, she shifted her focus more explicitly to the intersection of sex and power (<i>Erotica</i>, <i>Bedtime Stories</i>, the photo book <i>Sex</i>), with a sound that flirted with house, new jack swing, and late-night R&B. (Between “Vogue” and the tour documentary <i>Madonna: Truth or Dare</i>, it was also a moment when she leaned into her support of the LGBTQ community—a relationship that has defined her career.) Just as quickly as she’d embraced her inner sinner, she pivoted, first with a role as former Argentinian first lady Eva Perón in the 1996 film and soundtrack <i>Evita</i>, then with the 1998 album <i>Ray of Light</i>—projects that rechristened her as a mature, soul-searching artist in a chaotic world. She kept pace through the 2000s and 2010s, exploring disco, electro, and minimalistic takes on ’80s dance music, continuing to track the sound of the times while always, somehow, remaining herself.<br>\nWhen she was a young woman pursuing a dance career in New York, she’d been given a nickname by the famed choreographer Martha Graham: Madame X, a shape-shifting woman whose identity was, as the name suggests, a variable. About 40 years later, she embraced the moniker for 2019’s <i>Madame X</i>, an album influenced by the yearning fado music of her adopted home of Lisbon, Portugal."

            "artistBio": "In the late 2000s, social media gave misfits and outsiders the means to carve out their own personal space online, and attract legions of followers by presenting the most raw and unfiltered version of themselves. And no artist personified that moment quite like Kesha Rose Sebert (born 1987), the brash, potty-mouthed, nose-ringed anti-diva who crashed the Top 40 through her wailing cameo on Flo Rida’s 2009 synth-rap chart-topper, “Right Round,” and then stuck around like she owned the place. At a time when EDM-infused maximalism was reshaping the sound of pop music, Kesha united club kids, hip-hop heads, and indie hipsters under one festival tent through bratty bops like “TiK ToK” and “We R Who We R.” And she was also the rare omnivorous pop star who was just as eager to record Stooges tributes with psych-pop kings The Flaming Lips (“2012 [You Must Be Upgraded]”) as hook up with dance-rap pooh-bah Pitbull for his 2013 strobe-lit smash “Timber.” Behind the scenes, however, Kesha’s life was no party—a struggle with eating disorders and a nasty legal battle with her former producer, Dr. Luke, brought her career to a halt. By the time Kesha resurfaced with 2017’s <i>Rainbow</i>, she was being celebrated as an icon of the burgeoning #MeToo movement, and the album’s spirit of empowerment and emancipation filtered down to its non-conformist sound, which foregrounded the country, soul, and classic-rock influences she inherited from her musician mother, Pebe (who also guested on the record). And 2020’s <i>High Road</i> found her reclaiming the more sexualized persona of her earlier work, while doubling down on her reputation as pop’s most unpredictable polymath—who else could trade verses with NOLA bounce deity Big Freedia, collaborate with Grimes, and harmonize with Brian Wilson and Sturgill Simpson on the same record? “I’m not going to let something that happened to me in my past define who I’m going to be the rest of my life,” Kesha told Apple Music. “This record is me being like, ‘No—you’re not going to stick me in some box.’”"

            "artistBio": "She’s the dream girl. The free spirit. The candy-coated pinup and the well of inner strength. She’s a little Disney, a little Betty Boop. But she’s also an avatar for the modern female pop star in a post-Madonna world—the liberated woman who kicks open doors without knocking. Under all the sparkle and glitter, you could sense an artist grappling with messy human contradictions—about sexuality, about self-love, about asserting femininity in a man’s world. Talking to Apple Music in 2019, Katy Perry said she leads with her gut and lets her mind follow, and doesn’t make much sense of any of it until the work is done. “The themes are joy,” she said. “They are empowerment. They are trying to expand the boundaries of what I think, and trying to learn from all this opportunity.” She might actually be a superhero. But she also might just be what she is: a girl from Southern California who worked like crazy and didn’t flinch.<br>\nBorn in 1984 to Pentecostal pastors in Santa Barbara, Perry (originally Katy Hudson) grew up on gospel music, putting out her first album, 2001’s <I>Katy Hudson</I>, on a Christian label. At some point during adolescence, she discovered Queen, a band whose mix of flamboyance, power, and sexualized wit cracked her creative world open. (Perry named her fragrance Killer Queen, after one of the band’s signature songs.) Club tracks, ballads, classic pop-rock, and contemporary electronic music—Perry’s production collaborators are brilliant (Dr. Luke, Max Martin, benny blanco), but it's her songwriting, her image, her balance of playfulness and confidence that pull the package together. And for every “Teenage Dream” or “I Kissed a Girl,” there's a “Firework” or a “Roar,” music that turns expressions of vulnerability into anthems of inclusion and self-renewal—a dynamic that has made Perry an inspirational figure not only to young women, but for an LGBTQ community she vocally supports.<br>\nPerry doesn’t quite know how she went so platinum—2010’s <I>Teenage Dream</I> reached commercial heights previously set only by Michael Jackson—but while the numbers are nice, the work is what's important. “It’s up to me to make the right choice in my mind to keep putting one foot in front of the other and going forward,” Perry told Apple Music. “Not going backwards—I could easily go backwards by literally looking at a photo. But I have to go forward, because I know what’s good for me now.”"

            "artistBio": "Although Britney Spears’ career is often viewed through the lens of major ’80s teen-pop luminaries such as Debbie Gibson or Madonna, the vocalist outgrew her prefab, mall-music image and became one of the 21st century’s most adventurous pop stars. Spears’ initial performing experience came on TV, as a cast member on a ’90s reboot of <I>The Mickey Mouse Club</I>. After her time on that show ended, the Kentwood, LA-raised artist became a pillar of the nascent Y2K teen-pop boom: Her 1999 debut, <I>...Baby One More Time</I>, was certified diamond (10 times platinum) in less than a year, and the next year’s <I>Oops!...I Did It Again</I> shipped 9 million copies by mid-2001. Multiple dance-geared hits followed, courtesy of collaborations with sonic icons—Swedish pop guru Max Martin (“...Baby One More Time”), adventurous production team The Neptunes (“I’m a Slave 4 U”), and electro mavens Bloodshy and Avant (“Toxic”). Sales aside, however, Spears became one of the biggest pop stars ever due to the savvy way she expresses the complicated calculus of being a woman in the modern world. Her lyrics tackle massive fame, romantic drama, and the challenge of maintaining a sense of self—all of which translates to an emotionally vulnerable persona that finds Spears asserting she’s a survivor (“Stronger”), sexually empowered (woe to the cheater depicted in “Womanizer”), and not a pushover."

While coming up through the scenes in Atlanta in the ’80s and New York in the early ‘90s, RuPaul showed off some seriously fierce skills as a singer and dancer. A playful house anthem that became a trailblazing pop crossover in 1992, “Supermodel (You Better Work)” demonstrated RuPaul’s determination to sound as good as he looked. The releases that followed his 1993 debut album, <I>Supermodel of the World</I>, brandished the same risqué sensibility as his breakthrough hit: Who else but Ru would name a Christmas album <I>Ho Ho Ho</I>? And even as his cheeky competition show grew from cult favorite into a bona fide TV institution, RuPaul continued to delight fans with a steady stream of exuberant singles and albums that combined his ultra-fabulous persona with a wide range of dance-music styles, including the bounce influence that energizes 2014’s <I>Born Naked</I>."

            "artistBio": "Australia’s biggest pop icon is a master of shape-shifting, with a silvery voice that adapts to spunky novelty dance tracks as well as sleek synth-pop and a theatrical bent that turns her live shows into spectacles. Born in Melbourne in 1968, Kylie Minogue got her start in acting, debuting on the soap opera <I>Neighbours</I> in her teen years and almost immediately becoming one of the nation’s most beloved television actors. A benefit performance led to the release of her first single, a cover of Little Eva’s “The Loco-Motion,” in 1987; it became a hit in Australia, and her 1988 re-recording of it, helmed by the superproducer team Stock Aitken Waterman, was a worldwide smash. The new version was included on her 1988 debut, <I>Kylie</I>, a collection of frothy pop highlighted by the sparkling “I Should Be So Lucky.” Minogue continued her relationship with SAW until the 1993 release of <I>Kylie Minogue</I>, which was recorded with club-oriented producers including M People and Brothers In Rhythm. Her aesthetic matured during the ’90s, both in her solo work and on the Nick Cave duet “Where the Wild Roses Grow.” In 2001, the slick “Can’t Get You Out of My Head” blew up in clubs and on the radio, and its accompanying album, <I>Fever</I>, featuring the buoyant “Love At First Sight” and the sinuous “Come Into My World,” re-established Minogue as a pop force. She later worked with pop gurus like Stuart Price and Greg Kurstin on tracks such as the sumptuous “All the Lovers” and the peppy “Wow,” flirted with country and disco, indulged her art-house side in films like <I>Holy Motors</I>, and embarked on ambitious tours that showcased her flair for the dramatic—and her long-honed ability to captivate audiences."

            "artistBio": "A report card for Robyn Rihanna Fenty, first issued by a school back in Barbados’ Saint Michael parish and later reprinted in a giant coffee-table book called <I>RIHANNA</I>, stated, in part, that the young Fenty was positive, sure of herself. She took a leading role in group activities. Most of all, she had ideas and seemed comfortable expressing them. Fast-forward to the present day and there remains something effortless about Rihanna, a sense of confidence that transcends any one narrative or style. Though her biggest tracks tend toward some variety of dance pop (mixed with reggae, EDM, dancehall, R&B, and so on), a closer listen reveals an artist willing to try just about anything—and the uncanny grace to sound good doing it. Describing the chameleonic nature of her clothing line, Fenty—the first female-created brand for LVMH, not to mention its first luxury label run by a black woman—Rihanna said the line didn’t have any fixed look, in part because her own was always changing. She was making things up as she went along, but when she went, she went full-steam ahead.<br>\nBorn in Barbados in 1988, she left high school to pursue music. Her 2005 debut, <I>Music of the Sun</I>, went Gold when she was just 17. By 2007’s <I>Good Girl Gone Bad</I>, she’d expanded the sunny Caribbean pop of her early work for sleek hybrids of hip-hop, R&B, club music, and rock. Her tracks are inescapable—“Umbrella,” “Don’t Stop the Music,” “Rude Boy,” “Work”—but also have genuine personality, not to mention a carnal sense of expressiveness that sets her apart: Rihanna’s changes don’t seem like the product of high-concept self-reinvention so much as gut feeling. After leaving Def Jam in 2014 for a spot with Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, she took greater creative control for 2016’s <I>ANTI</I>, her most diverse album yet."

            "artistBio": "Though she’s got the name and look of a ’60s-era Hollywood star, Lana Del Rey could only have emerged in the internet era. At a time when social media was giving people the power to curate their identities and present idealized versions of themselves online, the struggling singer-songwriter once known as Lizzy Grant (born in New York in 1985) reinvented herself as Lana Del Rey for her epochal 2011 single “Video Games.” The wistful orchestral ballad (and an accompanying Super 8-style video that heralded the ubiquity of soft-focus Instagram filters) introduced a femme fatale who delighted in breaking hearts and the internet alike, knowingly using coquettish sex-kitten cliches as a means to probe male behavior and, by extension, the American id itself. Not only did the song prove it was possible to cultivate genuine mystique in the age of oversharing, but it also carved out a space for languid, <i>Twin Peaks</i>-worthy art-pop amid a Top 40 normally reserved for jacked-up pop anthems. Since then, Lana has always kept listeners guessing: Informed equally by classic-rock mythology and modern hip-hop attitude, she can casually name-drop Lou Reed in a dream-pop serenade (2014’s “Brooklyn Baby”) as effortlessly she communes with R&B futurist The Weeknd (2017’s “Lust for Life”). More than a mere retro stylist, Lana embraces nostalgic all-American imagery only to corrupt it through subversive—sometimes profane—anti-love songs, while elevating pop-cultural detritus into high art: On 2019’s <i>Norman F*****g Rockwell!</i>—an epic masterwork that scales the heights of Elton John’s early-'70s classics—she makes room for a cover of Sublime’s ’90s stoner-funk anthem “Doin’ Time,” giving it a sultry trip-hop makeover that affirms the mystery of Lana Del Rey continues to be written."

            "artistBio": "Kim Petras has spawned an entire generation of bunheads (as her fanbase is called) with her brand of hook-heavy, hedonistic synth-pop. Born in Cologne, Germany in 1992, Petras had aspirations of international stardom from an early age, writing her first songs at 13 and inspired by pop stars like Britney Spears and Spice Girls. Though she released minor works in the late 2000s, it was 2017’s “Unlock It,” the singer’s attention-grabbing collaboration with scene queen Charli XCX, that served for many as a gateway into her world. Petras' Era 1 collection of endorphin-popping bangers, elevated by her virtuosic vocal range, solidified her status as pop music royalty. Songs like 2017’s sugar-baby anthem “‎I Don't Want It At All” and 2018’s criminally catchy “Heart to Break” showcased her singer/songwriter prowess through a neon glow of ‘80s-infused dance pop. An indie artist at heart, Petras has released the bulk of her work on her own BunHead Records imprint. Her official full-length debut, <I>Clarity</I> (2019), found her eschewing some of the blithe spirit of her early songs in favor of a greater vulnerability in songs like “Icy” and “Broken,” where materialism becomes an escape from the emotional void of heartbreak. The hyper-sexualized <i>Slut Pop</i> arrived in 2022. Petras’ success has also turned her into a role model for the broad swath of her fanbase who identify as LGBTQ, celebrating her as a pioneer for transgender representation in the genre."

            "artistBio": "As a child, Robyn spent a good chunk of time touring with her parents' experimental theater group—an experience that ignited one of the more unusual trajectories in modern pop. Discovered performing at a school assembly, Robyn (born Robin Miriam Carlsson in Stockholm in 1979) launched her professional career at 15, cowriting every song on 1995's <i>Robyn Is Here</i>, including \"Show Me Love\" and \"Do You Know (What It Takes),\" both of which crossed over outside Sweden and made her a genuine if somewhat reluctant star. Burned by the conservatism of the industry (especially when it came to the treatment of young women), she left her label in the early 2000s in order to start her own—a move that essentially set her back to square one, but also made her an emblem of independence at a time when pop, as a sound, was beginning to split from the conventions of the business. Working slowly, deliberately, and with a small circle of collaborators (including Klas Ã…hlund of Teddybears and Joseph Mount of Metronomy), she helped redefine pop as something that could be cool and almost boutique, releasing a string of singles and EPs (including 2010's <i>Body Talk</i> series) by turns vulnerable and empowering, triumphant and deeply bittersweet—bangers you could weep to. After taking a nearly eight-year-long break from releasing solo music (a gamble almost unheard-of for a pop artist in their prime), Robyn returned in 2018 with <i>Honey</i>, recasting loss—romantic and personal—as the fire in which strong hearts are forged. \"I wish everyone could have a fan club that would just cheer them on and root for them,\" she told Apple Music. \"What if you have people on your Instagram, texting you, 'Yeah, I'm so excited you're going to work!'\" It was a joke, of course, but the sentiment—bringing the rush of pop to a human scale—is one she built a career on."

The “rah rah ah-ah-ah!” rallying cry of “Bad Romance” jolts a love song dressed up in mirror-ball drag, while “Telephone” pairs Gaga with Beyoncé for a feisty broadside against overzealous suitors and the grand ballad “Speechless” pays tribute to Gaga’s piano-bar roots.

              "standard": "“This music actually healed me.” That’s the hopeful message Lady Gaga brings with her as she emerges from something of a career detour—having mostly abandoned dance pop in favor of her 2016 album <i>Joanne</i>’s more stripped-back sound and the intimate singer-songwriter fare of 2018’s <i>A Star Is Born</i>. She returns with <i>Chromatica</i>, a concept album about an Oz-like virtual world of colors—produced by BloodPop®, who also worked on <i>Joanne</i>—and it’s a return to form for the disco diva. “I’m making a dance record again,” Gaga tells Apple Music, “and this dance floor, it’s mine, and I earned it.” As with many artists, music is a form of therapy for Gaga, helping her exorcise the demons of past family traumas. But it wasn’t until she could embrace her own struggles—with mental health, addiction and recovery, the trauma of sexual assault—that she felt free enough to start dancing again. “All that stuff that I went through, I don’t have to feel pain about it anymore. It can just be a part of me, and I can keep going.”<br />\nAnd that’s the freedom she wants her fans to experience—even if it will be a while before most of them can enjoy the new album in a club setting. “I can’t wait to dance with people to this music,” says Gaga. But until then, she hopes they’ll find a little therapy in the music, like she did. “It turns out if you believe in yourself, sometimes you’re good enough. I would love for people that listen to this record to feel and hear that.” Below, Lady Gaga walks us through some of the key tracks on <i>Chromatica</i> and explains the stories behind them.<br />\n<b>Chromatica I</b>\n“The beginning of the album symbolizes for me the beginning of my journey to healing. It goes right into this grave string arrangement, where you feel this pending doom that is what happens if I face all the things that scare me. That string arrangement is setting the stage for a more cinematic experience with this world that is how I make sense of things.”<br />\n<b>Alice</b>\n“I had some dark conversations with BloodPop® about how I felt about life. ‘I’m in the hole, I’m falling down/So down, down/My name isn’t Alice, but I’ll keep looking for Wonderland.’ So it’s this weird experience where I’m going, ‘I’m not sure I’m going to make it, but I’m going to try.’ And that’s where the album really begins.”<br />\n<b>Stupid Love</b>\n“In the ‘Stupid Love’ video, red and blue are fighting. It could decidedly be a political commentary. And it’s very divisive. The way that I see the world is that we are divided, and that it creates a tense environment that is very extremist. And it’s part of my vision of Chromatica, which is to say that this is not dystopian, and it’s not utopian. This is just how I make sense of things. And I wish that to be a message that I can translate to other people.”<br />\n<b>Rain on Me (With Ariana Grande)</b>\n“When we were vocally producing her, I was sitting at the console and I said to her, ‘Everything that you care about while you sing, I want you to forget it and just sing. And by the way, while you’re doing that, I’m going to dance in front of you,’ because we had this huge, big window. And she was like, ‘Oh my god, I can’t. I don’t know.’ And then she started to do things with her voice that were different. And it was the joy of two artists going, ‘I see you.’ Humans do this. We all do things to make ourselves feel safe, and I always challenge artists when I work with them, I go, ‘Make it super fucking unsafe and then do it again.’”<br />\n<b>Free Woman</b>\n“I was sexually assaulted by a music producer. It’s compounded all of my feelings about life, feelings about the world, feelings about the industry, what I had to compromise and go through to get to where I am. And I had to put it there. And when I was able to finally celebrate it, I said, ‘You know what? I’m not nothing without a steady hand. I’m not nothing unless I know I can. I’m still something if I don’t got a man, I’m a free woman.’ It’s me going, ‘I no longer am going to define myself as a survivor, or a victim of sexual assault. I just am a person that is free, who went through some fucked-up shit.’”<br />\n<b>911</b>\n“It’s about an antipsychotic that I take. And it’s because I can’t always control things that my brain does. I know that. And I have to take medication to stop the process that occurs. ‘Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes/Save it till I know I’m going to drop this front I’ve built around me/Oasis, paradise is in my hands/Holding on so tight to this status/It’s not real, but I’ll try to grab it/Keep myself in beautiful places, paradise is in my hands.’”<br />\n<b>Sine From Above (With Elton John)</b>\n“S-I-N-E, because it’s a sound wave. That sound, sine, from above is what healed me to be able to dance my way out of this album. ‘I heard one sine from above/I heard one sine from above/Then the signal split into the sound created stars like me and you/Before there was love, there was silence/I heard one sine and it healed my heart, heard a sine.’ That was later in the recording process that I actually was like, ‘And now let me pay tribute to the very thing that has revived me, and that is music.’”",

            "editorialNotes": {
              "standard": "For their retelling of the classic <i>A Star Is Born</i> tale—fading celebrity meets ingénue, passes torch—writer/director Bradley Cooper and costar Lady Gaga had to do a little role reversal. Gaga makes her first turn as a leading lady (big-voiced, fresh-faced singer Ally), while Cooper both directs and sings (aging country-rocker Jackson Maine) for the first time. It turns out that Cooper is just as impressive a singer as Gaga is an actress, and the intense dynamic between the two leads is present from the start.<br />\nAs Gaga told Beats 1 host Zane Lowe, the pair first huddled around the piano in her Malibu home to practice a Creedence Clearwater Revival song, and she was stunned when she first heard his singing voice. “Instantly we started to harmonize, and we were looking at each other and laughing, and it was just this magical experience.” Cooper claims the inspiration for his character came from Eddie Vedder; Gaga merely needed to look in the mirror, drawing on bittersweet memories of her pre-fame days as Stefani Germanotta, busking outside of bars on Manhattan's Lower East Side. “I was so bullied and so insecure and so depressed, and that is what I drew from,” she recalled.<br /> \nThat vulnerability is on display in the movie's central number, “Shallow,” a power ballad that comes closest to Gaga’s usual recorded fare. The rest of the soundtrack encompasses country-rockers (“Diggin’ My Grave”), Carole King-style piano bops (“Look What I Found”), and slow-dance duets (“Music to My Eyes”). This wide variety of Broadway-ready cues is the product of a dream team of songwriters, including Natalie Hemby, Hillary Lindsey, Jason Isbell, Lori McKenna, Julia Michaels, Lukas Nelson, and Mark Ronson.<br />\nBut what grounds it all is Gaga's and Cooper's star power, and their natural flair for the dramatic. The day they filmed the movie's climactic piano torch song, \"I'll Never Love Again,\" Gaga rushed from the soundstage to her friend Sonya’s bedside at the hospital; she passed away that day, after a long struggle with cancer. At the urging of Sonya's husband, Gaga drove right back to set and poured everything she was feeling into that performance. “I sang that song for Jackson,” she told Zane, “and for her.”",

It's not the stretch you might think. As her fans know, Gaga has chops. She's a piano whiz and a vocal acrobat, as she demonstrates by hitting those high notes on \"Nature Boy\" (dig the flute solo). And Bennett is Bennett: cool as ice and twice as smooth. The tunes are classically arranged with strings, horns, and walking bass lines: there are no art-pop detours here, and it's refreshing to hear Gaga singing absent the conceptual pomp of her usual fare. It may be just another one of her arch personas, but it's one she does exceptionally well."

The biblically minded “Judas” is a snarling, storming passion play, while the title track celebrates diversity by commanding the world to get on its feet. Gaga’s love of rock, meanwhile, comes through on the sweeping power ballad “Yoü and I” and the triumphant, Clarence Clemons-assisted “The Edge of Glory.”",
